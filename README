Release Notes for Valkyrie

Valkyrie version 2.0.1.SVN supports Valgrind 3.6.x.
Valkyrie supports the Valgrind tools Memcheck and Helgrind.

Valkyrie is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2. 
Read the file COPYING in the source distribution for details.

For instructions on how to build/install, see the INSTALL file.


Support for other versions of Valgrind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie is generally _not_ backwards compatible with other versions
of Valgrind.  In particular, a particular Valkyrie release is tuned
to a particular Valgrind XML interface definition.


How to get Valkyrie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To check out Valkyrie via anonymous, read-only svn access:
  svn co svn://svn.valgrind.org/valkyrie/trunk valkyrie


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qt (version 4.6 or later, earlier 4.x might also work) <http://www.trolltech.com>
Valgrind (3.6.x series) <http://www.valgrind.org>


Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie is a GPL'd graphical front-end to the Valgrind suite
of tools for debugging and profiling programs.

Valkyrie uses the Qt widget library, and (should) run on any platform
that both Qt and Valgrind run on.

To get the most out of Valkyrie, you must read the Valgrind
documentation: <http://www.valgrind.org/docs/>

To get started, simply invoke valkyrie thusly:
  valkyrie ./myprog

This will transparently call Valgrind and display its output.
