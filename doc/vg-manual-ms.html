<p>To use this tool, you must specify
<code class="computeroutput">--tool=massif</code> on the Valgrind
command line.</p>

<a name="ms-manual.spaceprof"></a>6.1. Heap profiling</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Massif is a heap profiler, i.e. it measures how much heap
memory programs use.  In particular, it can give you information
about:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Heap blocks;</p></li>
<li><p>Heap administration blocks;</p></li>
<li><p>Stack sizes.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Heap profiling is useful to help you reduce the amount of
memory your program uses.  On modern machines with virtual
memory, this provides the following benefits:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>It can speed up your program -- a smaller
    program will interact better with your machine's caches and
    avoid paging.</p></li>
<li><p>If your program uses lots of memory, it will
    reduce the chance that it exhausts your machine's swap
    space.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Also, there are certain space leaks that aren't detected by
traditional leak-checkers, such as Memcheck's.  That's because
the memory isn't ever actually lost -- a pointer remains to it --
but it's not in use.  Programs that have leaks like this can
unnecessarily increase the amount of memory they are using over
time.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="ms-manual.heapprof"></a>6.1.1. Why Use a Heap Profiler?</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Everybody knows how useful time profilers are for speeding
up programs.  They are particularly useful because people are
notoriously bad at predicting where are the bottlenecks in their
programs.</p>
<p>But the story is different for heap profilers.  Some
programming languages, particularly lazy functional languages
like <a href="http://www.haskell.org" target="_top">Haskell</a>, have
quite sophisticated heap profilers.  But there are few tools as
powerful for profiling C and C++ programs.</p>
<p>Why is this?  Maybe it's because C and C++ programmers must
think that they know where the memory is being allocated.  After
all, you can see all the calls to
<code class="computeroutput">malloc()</code> and
<code class="computeroutput">new</code> and
<code class="computeroutput">new[]</code>, right?  But, in a big
program, do you really know which heap allocations are being
executed, how many times, and how large each allocation is?  Can
you give even a vague estimate of the memory footprint for your
program?  Do you know this for all the libraries your program
uses?  What about administration bytes required by the heap
allocator to track heap blocks -- have you thought about them?
What about the stack?  If you are unsure about any of these
things, maybe you should think about heap profiling.</p>
<p>Massif can tell you these things.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's because it's relatively easy to add basic
heap profiling functionality into a program, to tell you how many
bytes you have allocated for certain objects, or similar.  But
this information might only be simple like total counts for the
whole program's execution.  What about space usage at different
points in the program's execution, for example?  And
reimplementing heap profiling code for each project is a
pain.</p>
<p>Massif can save you this effort.</p>

<p>First off, as for normal Valgrind use, you probably want to
compile with debugging info (the
<code class="computeroutput">-g</code> flag).  But, as opposed to
Memcheck, you probably <span><strong class="command">do</strong></span> want to turn
optimisation on, since you should profile your program as it will
be normally run.</p>
<p>Then, run your program with <code class="computeroutput">valgrind
--tool=massif</code> in front of the normal command
line invocation.  When the program finishes, Massif will print
summary space statistics.  It also creates a graph representing
the program's heap usage in a file called
<code class="filename">massif.pid.ps</code>, which can be read by any
PostScript viewer, such as Ghostview.</p>
<p>It also puts detailed information about heap consumption in
a file <code class="filename">massif.pid.txt</code> (text format) or
<code class="filename">massif.pid.html</code> (HTML format), where
<span class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span> is the program's process id.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="ms-manual.basicresults"></a>6.2.2. Basic Results of Profiling</h3></div></div></div>
<p>To gather heap profiling information about the program
<code class="computeroutput">prog</code>, type:</p>
<pre class="screen">
% valgrind --tool=massif prog</pre>
<p>The program will execute (slowly).  Upon completion,
summary statistics that look like this will be printed:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
==27519== Total spacetime:   2,258,106 ms.B
==27519== heap:              24.0%
==27519== heap admin:         2.2%
==27519== stack(s):          73.7%</pre>
<p>All measurements are done in
<span class="emphasis"><em>spacetime</em></span>, i.e. space (in bytes) multiplied
by time (in milliseconds).  Note that because Massif slows a
program down a lot, the actual spacetime figure is fairly
meaningless; it's the relative values that are
interesting.</p>
<p>Which entries you see in the breakdown depends on the
command line options given.  The above example measures all the
possible parts of memory:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Heap: number of words allocated on the heap, via
    <code class="computeroutput">malloc()</code>,
    <code class="computeroutput">new</code> and
    <code class="computeroutput">new[]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Heap admin: each heap block allocated requires some
    administration data, which lets the allocator track certain
    things about the block.  It is easy to forget about this, and
    if your program allocates lots of small blocks, it can add
    up.  This value is an estimate of the space required for this
    administration data.</p></li>
<li><p>Stack(s): the spacetime used by the programs' stack(s).
    (Threaded programs can have multiple stacks.)  This includes
    signal handler stacks.</p></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="ms-manual.graphs"></a>6.2.3. Spacetime Graphs</h3></div></div></div>
<p>As well as printing summary information, Massif also
creates a file representing a spacetime graph,
<code class="filename">massif.pid.hp</code>.  It will produce a file
called <code class="filename">massif.pid.ps</code>, which can be viewed in
a PostScript viewer.</p>
<p>Massif uses a program called
<code class="computeroutput">hp2ps</code> to convert the raw data
into the PostScript graph.  It's distributed with Massif, but
came originally from the 
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/" target="_top">Glasgow Haskell
Compiler</a>.  You shouldn't need to worry about this at all.
However, if the graph creation fails for any reason, Massif will
tell you, and will leave behind a file named
<code class="filename">massif.pid.hp</code>, containing the raw heap
profiling data.</p>
<p>Here's an example graph:</p>
<div class="mediaobject">
<a name="spacetime-graph"></a><img src="images/massif-graph-sm.png" alt="Spacetime Graph">
</div>
<p>The graph is broken into several bands.  Most bands
represent a single line of your program that does some heap
allocation; each such band represents all the allocations and
deallocations done from that line.  Up to twenty bands are shown;
less significant allocation sites are merged into "other" and/or
"OTHER" bands.  The accompanying text/HTML file produced by
Massif has more detail about these heap allocation bands.  Then
there are single bands for the stack(s) and heap admin
bytes.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>it's the height of a band that's important.  Don't let the
ups and downs caused by other bands confuse you.  For example,
the <code class="computeroutput">read_alias_file</code> band in the
example has the same height all the time it's in existence.</p>
<p>The triangles on the x-axis show each point at which a
memory census was taken.  These aren't necessarily evenly spread;
Massif only takes a census when memory is allocated or
deallocated.  The time on the x-axis is wallclock time, which is
not ideal because you can get different graphs for different
executions of the same program, due to random OS delays.  But
it's not too bad, and it becomes less of a problem the longer a
program runs.</p>
<p>Massif takes censuses at an appropriate timescale; censuses
take place less frequently as the program runs for longer.  There
is no point having more than 100-200 censuses on a single
graph.</p>
<p>The graphs give a good overview of where your program's
space use comes from, and how that varies over time.  The
accompanying text/HTML file gives a lot more information about
heap use.</p>

<p>The text/HTML file contains information to help interpret
the heap bands of the graph.  It also contains a lot of extra
information about heap allocations that you don't see in the
graph.</p>
<p>Here's part of the information that accompanies the above
graph.</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote">

<li><p>and 6 other insignificant places</p></li>
</ul></div>
</blockquote></div>
<p>The first part shows the total spacetime due to heap
allocations, and the places in the program where most memory was
allocated (Nb: if this program had been compiled with
<code class="computeroutput">-g</code>, actual line numbers would be
given).  These places are sorted, from most significant to least,
and correspond to the bands seen in the graph.  Insignificant
sites (accounting for less than 0.5% of total spacetime) are
omitted.</p>
<p>That alone can be useful, but often isn't enough.  What if
one of these functions was called from several different places
in the program?  Which one of these is responsible for most of
the memory used?  For
<code class="computeroutput">_nl_intern_locale_data()</code>, this
question is answered by clicking on the 
<a href="#b401767D1" target="_top">22.1%</a> link, which takes us to the
following part of the file:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<a name="b401767D1"></a><blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="literallayout"><p>== 1 ===========================</p></div>
<p>Context accounted for <a href="#a401767D1" target="_top">22.1%</a>

<p><code class="computeroutput"> 0x401767D0: _nl_intern_locale_data (in

<p>Called from:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a name="a40176F96"></a>
    <a href="#b40176F96" target="_top">22.1%</a>: 0x40176F95:
    _nl_load_locale_from_archive (in
    /lib/i686/libc-2.3.2.so)</p></li></ul></div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>At this level, we can see all the places from which
<code class="computeroutput">_nl_load_locale_from_archive()</code>
was called such that it allocated memory at 0x401767D0.  (We can
click on the top <a href="#a40176F96" target="_top">22.1%</a> link to go back
to the parent entry.)  At this level, we have moved beyond the
information presented in the graph.  In this case, it is only
called from one place.  We can again follow the link for more
detail, moving to the following part of the file.</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="literallayout"><p>== 2 ===========================</p></div>
<p><a name="b40176F96"></a>
Context accounted for <a href="#a40176F96" target="_top">22.1%</a> of
measured spacetime</p>
<p><code class="computeroutput"> 0x401767D0: _nl_intern_locale_data (in
/lib/i686/libc-2.3.2.so)</code> <code class="computeroutput">
0x40176F95: _nl_load_locale_from_archive (in
/lib/i686/libc-2.3.2.so)</code></p>
<p>Called from:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a name="a40176185"></a>22.1%: 0x40176184: _nl_find_locale (in
    /lib/i686/libc-2.3.2.so)</p></li></ul></div>
</blockquote></div>
<p>In this way we can dig deeper into the call stack, to work
out exactly what sequence of calls led to some memory being
allocated.  At this point, with a call depth of 3, the
information runs out (thus the address of the child entry,
0x40176184, isn't a link).  We could rerun the program with a
greater <code class="computeroutput">--depth</code> value if we
wanted more information.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will get a code location like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
30.8% : 0xFFFFFFFF: ???</pre>
<p>The code address isn't really 0xFFFFFFFF -- that's
impossible.  This is what Massif does when it can't work out what
the real code address is.</p>
<p>Massif produces this information in a plain text file by
default, or HTML with the
<code class="computeroutput">--format=html</code> option.  The plain
text version obviously doesn't have the links, but a similar
effect can be achieved by searching on the code addresses.  (In
Vim, the '*' and '#' searches are ideal for this.)</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="ms-manual.accuracy"></a>6.3.1. Accuracy</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The information should be pretty accurate.  Some
approximations made might cause some allocation contexts to be
attributed with less memory than they actually allocated, but the
amounts should be miniscule.</p>
<p>The heap admin spacetime figure is an approximation, as
described above.  If anyone knows how to improve its accuracy,
please let us know.</p>

<a name="ms-manual.options"></a>6.4. Massif options</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Massif-specific options are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><a name="heap"></a><code class="computeroutput">--heap=no</code></p>
<p><code class="computeroutput">--heap=yes</code> [default]</p>
<p>When enabled, profile heap usage in detail.  Without
    it, the <code class="filename">massif.pid.txt</code> or
    <code class="filename">massif.pid.html</code> will be very
    short.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="heap-admin"></a><code class="computeroutput">--heap-admin=n</code>
    [default: 8]</p>
<p>The number of admin bytes per block to use.  This can
    only be an estimate of the average, since it may vary.  The
    allocator used by <code class="computeroutput">glibc</code>
    requires somewhere between 4--15 bytes per block, depending
    on various factors.  It also requires admin space for freed
    blocks, although Massif does not count this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="stacks"></a><code class="computeroutput">--stacks=no</code></p>
<p><code class="computeroutput">--stacks=yes</code> [default]</p>
<p>When enabled, include stack(s) in the profile.
    Threaded programs can have multiple stacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="depth"></a><code class="computeroutput">--depth=n</code>
    [default: 3]</p>
<p>Depth of call chains to present in the detailed heap
    information.  Increasing it will give more information, but
    Massif will run the program more slowly, using more memory,
    and produce a bigger <code class="computeroutput">.txt</code> /
    <code class="computeroutput">.hp</code> file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="alloc-fn"></a><code class="computeroutput">--alloc-fn=name</code></p>
<p>Specify a function that allocates memory.  This is
    useful for functions that are wrappers to
    <code class="computeroutput">malloc()</code>, which can fill up
    the context information uselessly (and give very
    uninformative bands on the graph).  Functions specified will
    be ignored in contexts, i.e. treated as though they were
    <code class="computeroutput">malloc()</code>.  This option can
    be specified multiple times on the command line, to name
    multiple functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="format"></a><code class="computeroutput">--format=text</code> [default]</p>
<p><code class="computeroutput">--format=html</code></p>
<p>Produce the detailed heap information in text or HTML
